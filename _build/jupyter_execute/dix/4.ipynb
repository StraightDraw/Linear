    "# A.4 Dollar sign math for creating vectors from columns of matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematicians have been using LaTeX for decades. Recently, the wider scientific community has embraced it, and hipper and younger folks are referring to it as dollar sign math. Conversion functions from MATLAB to DSM are incredibly useful for instructors creating tests, quizzes and other class materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating matrices is time-consuming enough in DSM, but what if you want to create five vectors? Even using my `dsm` function, that's five time the work. However, the following code creates an indexed set of vectors from the columns of a matrix.\n",
