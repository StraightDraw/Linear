# 5.1 Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvector
: An eigenvector of $A$ is a nonzero vector $\vec v$ in $\mathbb R^n$ such that $A\vec v = \lambda \vec v$, for some scalar $\lambda$.

Eigenvalue
: An eigenvalue of $A$ is a scalar $\lambda$ such that the equation $A\vec v = \lambda \vec v$ has a nontrivial solution.

**Terminology.** If $A\vec v = \lambda \vec v$ for some vector $\vec v\neq \vec 0$, we say that $\lambda$ is the eigenvalue for $\vec v$, and that $\vec v$ is an eigenvector for $\lambda$.
