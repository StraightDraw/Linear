# Chapter 5

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

````{warning}
Reading these materials and doing the excercises is **not enough** to understand the course material. You must also read and study the corresponding chapters and sections in the Margalit and Rabinoff [*Linear Algebra* online textbook](https://textbooks.math.gatech.edu/ila/chap-eigenvalues.html).
````
The information below is like a study guide though much of the information is copied directly from Margalit and Rabinoff. You will be quizzed and tested not only on how to perform various tasks in MATLAB, but on your understanding of the visualizations and discussions in the textbook. Be sure to study these concepts prior to quizzes and tests.
