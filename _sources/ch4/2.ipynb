    "Most linear algebra courses and textbooks define the determinant in terms of cofactor expansion, then mention how the determinant can also be found using row operations and the fact that the determinant of a triangular matrix is the product of its diagonals. Cofactors reduce the dimension of the matrices we need to find the determinant by one level. A $4\\times 4$ determinant is composed of four cofactors, each of which includes a $3\\times 3$ determinant.\n",
